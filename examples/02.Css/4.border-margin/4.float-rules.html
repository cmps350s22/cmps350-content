    <p>The country's rapid development highlighted the need for the College's expansion, to provide additional areas of specialization in line with the requirements of the population. &nbsp;Therefore, in 1977, Qatar University was founded with four new colleges; Education, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Sharia, Law &amp; Islamic Studies, and Science. From there, the institution rapidly expanded, with the founding of the College of Engineering in 1980 and College of Business in 1985.&nbsp; In addition, it originally supported several small independent research centers, and worked to establish a national community college; the College of Technology.</p>
